NOTE: THIS WILL NOT WORK IN VS CODE RIGHT OFF THE BAT
YOU WILL NEED: JavaFX, IntelliJ(not really, but recommend for this)
Once everything is downloaded to set up JavaFX, you can watch the YouTube video below, and everything should run.
TO SET THE VM: THE MAIN FILE FOR INTELLIJ IS THE "LoginUi.java" FILE__

Name ideas: To-Do, Listy, DueList, StudyDo, PlanForge, TaskSpark, StudyDo, FocusPilot
"Smarter Tasks. Sharper Mind"
Ui Color Scheme: Orange and Black/Blue and White
Logo: Orange and Black Calendar/Blue and White Calendar

Intended goal/idea: A list of the user's daily tasks, assessments, and daily activities. Unlike regular calendar apps and trackers, this app will give you the option to sort out stuff(ex, if it's a homework assignment, it will see it's a homework assignment and remind you differently because it's a homework assignment). Also, unlike other calendar apps and trackers, it will be much more detailed and focused, like you'll have the option of adding a date when the assignment is due(yes, even within a day) and stuff like the ability to study and practice questions, much like Quizlet, but focused more on active recall, motavial quotes, plugin like features.

To Do list flyout
A Windows flyout(or app) that will add a to-do list using Java
This project should give you an idea of how to make things work
DO NOT USE CHATGPT

Do you know how this will be done? - Java, JavaFX
